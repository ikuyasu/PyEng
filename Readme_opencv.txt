The bottom of this site:
https://github.com/Asymptote/asymptote.github.io/wiki/Vagrant,-Ubuntu,-rtmp-nginx-module,-ffmpeg,-python-with-openCV-binding

has links to "installing ffmpeg from source-code" and "installing OpenCV3.0 with
Python 3.4+ binding".

The problem was that I don't really know how to run a script on virtual box with vagrant
and Ubuntu installed. So, I tried to run a line by line, but some lines take too long to
complete or stall and I don't know if it stops the process or actually doing something 
without showing any output on a bash window. 

I have a Dell windowns 10 machine. I installed virtual box and vagrant and ubuntu trusty
version. 

At any rate, it will be difficult for the readers to install opencv3.0 and mpage module
without a great tutorial.
